# 🚀 Semantic Release Setup Complete!

Your Rust TUI project is now fully configured for automated semantic releases with GitHub Actions.

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 1. **TUI Integration** 
- Added semantic release screen in the TUI application
- 4 operations available:
  - 🔍 **Dry Run**: Check what would be released
  - 🚀 **Release**: Execute semantic-release 
  - 📦 **Last Release**: View last release info
  - ⚙️ **Configuration**: Check semantic-release config
- Results window with syntax highlighting and scrolling
- Cross-platform command execution (Windows/Unix)

### 2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Automated Testing**: Runs on all PRs and pushes
  - Rust formatting check (`cargo fmt`)
  - Clippy linting (`cargo clippy`)
  - Unit tests (`cargo test`)
  - Release build (`cargo build --release`)

- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Creates binaries for:
  - 🐧 Linux x64
  - 🪟 Windows x64  
  - 🍎 macOS x64
  - 🍎 macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)

- **Automated Releases**: On push to `main`
  - Analyzes commit messages
  - Determines version bump (patch/minor/major)
  - Generates changelog
  - Creates GitHub release with binaries
  - Updates version files

### 3. **Semantic Release Configuration** (`.releaserc.json`)
- Conventional commits analysis
- Automatic changelog generation
- GitHub releases with binary assets
- Version updates in `Cargo.toml` and `package.json`
- Git commits for releases

### 4. **Package Dependencies** (`package.json`)
- All required semantic-release plugins:
  - `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`
  - `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`
  - `@semantic-release/changelog`
  - `@semantic-release/github`
  - `@semantic-release/git`

## 🎯 Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. **Set Up GitHub Repository Secrets**
Navigate to your GitHub repository and add these secrets:

**Required:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Personal access token with `repo` permissions

**Optional:**
- `NPM_TOKEN`: If you plan to publish to npm

### 2. **Configure Branch Protection**
- Protect your `main` branch
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks to pass

### 3. **Test the Setup**
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make changes with conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add awesome new feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve critical bug"
   git commit -m "docs: update README"
   ```
3. Open a PR → Watch tests run automatically
4. Merge to main → Watch release happen automatically!

## 📋 Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits for automatic versioning:

| Type | Description | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat:` | New feature | Minor (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) |
| `fix:` | Bug fix | Patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) |
| `feat!:` | Breaking change | Major (0.1.0 → 1.0.0) |
| `docs:` | Documentation | None |
| `chore:` | Maintenance | None |
| `refactor:` | Code refactoring | None |
| `test:` | Tests | None |

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check GitHub Actions
- Go to your repo → "Actions" tab
- Monitor workflow runs
- Check logs if anything fails

### Test Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test semantic-release (dry run)
npx semantic-release --dry-run

# Test your TUI app
cargo run
# Navigate to Semantic Release tab
# Try the dry run option
```

### View Releases
- Go to your repo → "Releases" section
- Each successful release will appear here with:
  - Release notes
  - Version tags
  - Binary downloads

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Add More Release Assets
Edit `.releaserc.json` to include additional files:
```json
{
  "assets": [
    { "path": "docs/**", "label": "Documentation" },
    { "path": "examples/**", "label": "Examples" }
  ]
}
```

### Change Version Rules  
Modify commit analysis rules:
```json
["@semantic-release/commit-analyzer", {
  "releaseRules": [
    {"type": "refactor", "release": "patch"},
    {"type": "style", "release": "patch"}
  ]
}]
```

### Add Slack/Discord Notifications
Add notification plugins for release announcements.
